# spambot
A powerfull spambot.

In the spam.txt put what you want to spam.

If you want to spam in repeat mode where one thing is repetitavly sent write this on the first line.
If you wich to spam multiple different mesages write each message on each line.

You can run with or without arguments.

If you run without arguments you will be prompted to either chose multiline mode, repeat mode or to get help.

Running multiline mode will directly start the 5 second countdown before spamming.

Running help will tell you waht each mode does.

Running repeat will ask for the amount of times to send the mesage and then start the five second timer.

You can avoid these steps by putting in arguments:
-r = repeat mode,
-m = multiline mode,
-h = help.

Further you can give extra arguments.

For repeat mode there is 2 arguments arg 1 is number of times to send.
However arg 2 is only achievable through args and it specifies how much seconds to leave between mesages, default 0.5.

For multiline mode the only argument is secconds between mesages, once again defaulting to 0.5.

Help has no arguments.

Changing time between mesages is not recomended as can get you banned on some platforms.
Also we dont condone use of this bot unless its against someone who has consented for it to be used against them.
